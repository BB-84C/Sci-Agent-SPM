It only tells the current status of scanning: <scanning>, <paused>, and <idle>, if you need to get how long the scanning will take, refer to the scan time countdown ROI.

If the icon is in black and has a square gray shadow background, then it means the scanning is on paused, return: <paused>. If the icon is in faded gray color, it means there's no scanning in progress, return <idle>. Note that sometimes the LLM will fail distinguishing image between <scanning>, <paused> or <idle>, it is not uncommom. So if you see the scanning countdown is already zero, and the scanning status is identified as <scanning> or <paused>, it's actually in <idle>. As long as the the scanning status is in either <paused> or <idle>, you can start another scanning or proceed to change any parameters, it's totally safe. ",

Thi anchor specifically set the scan speed in unit \"time/line\", for example, if you want to set the scan speed to 400ms/line, input 400m or 0.4. If the user ask to set the scan speed in m/s unit, you need to refer to the read_scan_frame_size, and convert the user specified scan speed into the line/s unit. For example, the user ask to set the scan speed to 50nm/s, you need to take a look at the scan frame size (let's say it is 75nm), then your input for this anchor should be 1.5 or 1500m, since 75/50 = 1.5. Sometimes user will just simply ask to set a map that finished in <x> minutes, you need to calculate the total times in seconds and divid it by the twice of the pixels size (becuase of forward scan and backward scan, one line will always be scanned twice.). For example, user ask to set the map that finishes in 5min 47s, the pixel is set to 256, thus the scan time you should input is 678m, since 5min47s/(2*256pixel) = 678.4ms. NOTE: The nanonis only allow certain values as the input, expect small differnce. For example, if you set the scan speed to be 170m/s, but observed 176.2m/s as result, that's nanonis automatically set the input to the closest allowed value, live with that and don't have to try to reset the input to be exact 170m/s since nanonis will never let you set that value.

If the icon is in black and has a square gray shadow background, then it means the scanning is on paused, return: <paused>. If the icon is in faded gray color, it means there's no scanning in progress, return <idle>. Note that sometimes the LLM will fail distinguishing image to be <paused> or <idle>, it is not uncommom. So if you see the scanning countdown is already zero, and the scanning status is identified as <paused>, it's actually in <idle>. ",
